# Numerical methods for Ordinary Differential Equations

This library was built for a university class. The teacher's contribution is acknowledged in the files that have he's name commented.

Some implemented functionality:

* Solutions are lists of points, but you can evaluate anywhere you want. This is implemented using interpolation between each pair of points, and the order of the interpolation matches the order of the method used.
* The user can create an event, with a test function and an action.
